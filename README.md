# Safe city finder

Safe city finder is an API that provides the user with a random city to potentially travel to as well as geolocation so that the distance between the user and the city can be visualized. The API provides the user with almost 200 cities to travel to in Illinois

## Installation

No installation required, simply use the url and accept the geolocation request

## Roadmap

I plan to add accounts, a list of things to do in each city, comparison of random city crime index and users city crime index and anything else that I can think of. Definitely more to come in the future
